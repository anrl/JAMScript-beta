# TODO

- Contact mDNS guy regarding 15 character service type limitation
    - tried but his email online didn't work - need to submit an issue on github: https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns

- implement clutter control: MQTT broker and mDNS should trash old messages, especially if the node responsible for them has long gone offline
